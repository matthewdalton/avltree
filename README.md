avltree
=======

Simple AVL Tree (self balancing binary search tree) implementation.

Implemented in C++, but does not yet use templates. Nodes contain only an integer (the key) and contain no payload
(ie. value).

Nodes can be added to the tree, but the remove() operation is not yet implemented.
(Search is also not yet implemented!)
